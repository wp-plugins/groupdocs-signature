Collect signatures online by embedding documents into your pages as digital forms. Once a form is embedded, signers apply an electronic signature, directly online.

== Description ==

GroupDocs Signature is an efficient digital signature service that is completely web-based. GroupDocs' easy-to-use electronic signature service lets you collect digital signatures without the administrative overhead of printing, envelope stuffing and posting. It saves time and effort.

First, simply add fields and prepare your documents for signing. You can prepare any number of signature forms with fields for signature, date, initials, etc. using the Signature app at GroupDocs.com.Then share the forms with the people who needs to sign them. The signers sign the documents online in a browser. As soon as the document is signed, you are notified.

After installing the plugin, embed forms to your web pages. To embed signature forms you only need the form's ID. Your customers can now sign documents online directly on your website.

GroupDocs Signature gives you a greener, paperless office.
